# VPS-Audit

Checks virtualization type, memory isolation, and **some** security hardening on a VPS and notifies if there are any issues. 

Uses: Useful for having a quick glance for obvious faults, when instaling or modifying a VPS. 

What it cannot do: The script doesn't do a comprehensive malware/virus/trojan scan.
